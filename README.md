The usage of this program is as follows;
opencv_resize_crop_rotate test_image 224 224 45 120 120

opencv_resize_crop_rotate argv[0] argv[1] argv[2] argv[3] argv[4] argv[5] argv[6] 
argv[0] = image_name
argv[2] and argv[3] = x and y values of the resizeImage function
argv[4] = rotate angle of the rotateImage function
argv[5] and argv[6] are x and y values of the cropImage function.
